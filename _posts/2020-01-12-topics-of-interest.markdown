Few topics that i am currently researching in:

Synthetic Control

Financial model
        that uses autoML to provide insights on the best way to retain or maximise your net worth.

        Parameters:
         Assets such as Gold/Crude
         Food stocks such as Onions.etc
         ETFs
         Bonds

Academic System
        is the current academic system broken ?
        students are taught in class to compete and achieve A/A*s, curiousity in the subject matter is disincentivized,
        teachers/textbook material cannot be challenged.
        Does this mean that we have reached the end of the road in the subject, as we choose to think within the confined zone, or
        the Capitalism has made a system where every student is lead into an abyss, where the educational institutions earn on every stage.
