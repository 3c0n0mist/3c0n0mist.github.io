# Few topics that i am currently researching in:

## 1. Synthetic Control

## 2. Financial model
that uses auto ML to provide insights on the best way to retain or maximise your net worth.
*Parameters:
   - Assets such as Gold/Crude
   - Food stocks such as Onions.etc
   - ETFs
   - Bonds

## 3. Academic System
*Is the current academic system broken ?*

students are taught in class to compete and achieve A/A*s, curiosity in the subject matter is disincentivized,
teachers/textbook material cannot be challenged.

*Does this mean that we have reached the end of the road in the subject, as we choose to think within the confined zone, or the Capitalism has made a system where every student is lead into an abyss, where the educational institutions earn on every stage.*
